# orchestralc
Runtime free template-to-rust compiler

# what is orchestralc? why?
Orchestralc is a minimalist templating engine that converts templates into flexible, type safe rust functions that run without a specific runtime (only the rust standard library is required) in nearly any context. Orchestralc is minimalist and light, compiles the entire template, and will soon offer functionality expected of any modern templating engine. Orchestralc supports a modified (typesafe) subset of Tera/Jinja2, hereby refered to as 'Orchard'
